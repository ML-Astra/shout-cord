# ShoutCord
## Discord-Shoutcast Radio Bot

I made this over about 4 hours after an idea that was sparked whilst in a friend's stream.

It's setup to accept a shout/icecast url and play it through discord voice.

If you wish to add the bot to your own server, go [HERE](https://zer0xeon.xyz/bots/shoutcord.html)

It is currently running on heroku free. If you wish to help contribute to keeping the bot running please join my [patreon](https://www.pateron.com/zer0xeon), every dollar helps!

If you want to spin-up your instance its really simple.
- Download or clone the repo
- Run npm install
- Add your prefix and bot key to the example.config.json file
- Rename that file to config.json
- Run npm start.

And bob's your uncle, your own ShoutCord Bot!
